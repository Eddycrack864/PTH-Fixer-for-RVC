# PTH-Fixer-for-RVC
## Applio has recently updated its version of PyTorch so recently trained models may not work on:
* Hugging Face Spaces (Like Ilaria RVC)
* W Okada Realtime Voice Changer
* Mainline or Mangio based Colab Notebooks

It appears that when the project transitioned to the new version of PyTorch, some key names in the dictionaries were altered. This change has rendered me unable to use a .pth file generated with Applio in the original RVC webUI.
